# CreditScore

This is an app where a user is presented with their credit score and credit profile.
They can navigate to a details screen with more information from their profile.
The donut on the dashboard screen also represents their score.

Considerations:

The app has an app icon for easy recognition amongst other apps.
The app has a blue theme because it is a neutral colour that doesnâ€™t invoke a positive/negative feeling, like green or red would. This helps users feel calm about their finances.
Not all the JSON data was parsed - I only included what is relevant to the user, as that is what is presented in the app.

Improvements:

Given more time -

- I would adjust the white rounded rectangle in the background, as it does not fill all the space at the top when using an iPhone SE device.

- I would like the progress bar on the details screen to have a trailing alignment, as it would line up with the other information better.

- I would add Snapshot tests to test the Dashboard and Details Screens.

- I would  write a unit test for the network request that passes. I would also write a test for the view model.
